## Design üìê

The main challenge of this project would be the implementation of the scrollbars, you need to invert the container for the table in such a way that the scrollbars would be position on the top and left part of your table, while the ID is stickied on the left most part of the table.

Step by step implementation would be

1. Implement API Calls
2. Create Table based on the API results
3. Create modal for user details
4. Add click event on row that would trigger the modal opening. It has the user details
5. Create container for the table that would have the overflow of the table.
6. Add styling direction: rtl to both the container and table (so you would able to position the scrollbar to the left)
7. Add styling transform: scaleY(-1) to both the container and also the table.
8. Sticky the last column (id, since it's RTL) on the left side of the table
9. Apply other table styling.
